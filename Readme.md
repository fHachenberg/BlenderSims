BlenderSims Plugin for Blender
==============================

Mission
-------
The BlenderSims Plugin for Blender will be a plugin which allows
to browse and import various assets from The Sims™.

The Sims™ is a trademark of Maxis and Electronic Arts.

Requirements
------------

* PySims Lib (https://github.com/fHachenberg/PySims)
* Blender 2.76b or above
* Gamedata from the The Sims™

Installation
------------

(TODO) Not ready yet

Development
-----------

Currently there are only a couple of loosely coupled routines to
import specific assets but they are very inconvenient to use (see loadmesh.py)
No GUI yet :(
